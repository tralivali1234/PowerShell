Docker
======

These DockerFiles enable building and running PowerShell in a container for each Linux distribution we support.
There are two sets: release and nightly.

This requires an up-to-date version of Docker, such as 1.12.
It also expects you to be able to run Docker without `sudo`.
Please follow [Docker's official instructions][install] to install `docker` correctly.

[install]: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

Release
-------

The release containers derive from the official distribution image,
such as `centos:7`, then install dependencies,
and finally install the PowerShell package.

These containers live at [hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/powershell][docker-release].

At about 440 megabytes, they are decently minimal,
with their size being the sum of the base image (200 megabytes)
plus the uncompressed package (120 megabytes),
and about 120 megabytes of .NET Core and bootstrapping dependencies.

[docker-release]: https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/powershell/

Nightly
-------

The nightly containers derive from their respective release images,
such as `microsoft/powershell:centos7`,
then run the `bootstrap.ps1` script which clones the repository,
runs `Start-PSBootstrap -Package` to install building and packaging tools,
runs `Start-PSBuild -Crossgen -PSModuleRestore` to build PowerShell with native-image DLLs,
runs `Start-PSPackage` to generate the platform's package,
and finally installs the generated package.

These containers live at [hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/powershell-nightly][docker-nightly].

At about 4 gigabytes,
these images are *much* larger due to having all the tools installed.
This is intended so that the containers are useful for reproducing packages.

[docker-nightly]: https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/powershell-nightly/

Automation
==========

A script, `launch.sh`, exists to automatically build all the respective images.
It has a few configuration options,
passed in as environment variables:

* `FORK`: the fork to clone in nightly builds (default: `PowerShell`)
  * Set `FORK=andschwa` to clone https://github.com/andschwa/PowerShell

* `BRANCH`: the branch to checkout in nightly builds (default: `master`)
  * Set `BRANCH=feature-A` to checkout the `feature-A` branch

* `BUILDS`: the type of builds to run (default: `release nightly`)
  * This is order dependent! Release images must exist for nightly images to be built
  * Set `BUILDS=release` to run the script for just the release images

* `DISTROS`: the distributions of Linux to run (default: `ubuntu14.04 ubuntu16.04 centos7`)
  * Set `DISTROS=centos7` to build just CentOS 7 images
  * Combine with `BUILDS` to filter

* `TEST`: set to 1 to `docker run Start-PSPester` inside the containers
  * The containers *must* first exist; this skips the build step

* `BUILDARGS`: additional arguments to be passed to `docker build` during building
  * Set `BUILDARGS="--no-cache"` to rebuild and ignore cached layers

* `RUNARGS`: additional arguments to be passed to `docker run` during testing
  * Set `RUNARGS="--rm"` to automatically delete the test container when finished

For each build type (release and nightly),
the selected distributions will run in parallel.
The output is sent to log files in `docker/logs`.
For nightly builds, the generated packages are copied to `docker/packages`.

This script is very new, and there may be bugs.
Use `set -x` to see exactly what commands it is running.

To build a CentOS container with the latest released package:

```sh
$ BUILDS=release DISTROS=centos7 ./launch.sh
Logging to docker/logs/release/centos7.log
Waiting for release containers to finish; tail the logs for more information.

$ docker images
